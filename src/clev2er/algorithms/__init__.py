# Algorithm Directories

The clev2er -> **algorithms** contains sub-directories for each chain.  

For example:  `clev2er.algorithms.cryotempo`

in this case **cryotempo** is the chain name, and the *cryotempo* directory contains
algorithms for its chain.

## Templates directory

The `clev2er.algorithms.templates` directory contains a template algorithm to be copied for
new chain algorithms.
